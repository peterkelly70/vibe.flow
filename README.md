> "A philosophy of structure that doesn’t fight creativity."

**Vibe-Flow** is more than a Git workflow — it's a mindset for working with large language models. It turns chaotic AI-generated code into reproducible, clean checkpoints without losing the rhythm of creativity. Inspired by jazz, automation, and sane defaults, it lets you guide your repo like a conductor guides an orchestra.

## Branch Philosophy

```text
main           ← Clean, linear history. Only snapshot commits from iterations.
  ↑
  │
iterations     ← Fast, messy, vibe-coded development zone.
  │
  ├── feature/foo   ← (optional) isolated experiments
```

## Git Commands (via Vibe-Flow)

| Command               | Purpose                                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git vibe.iterate [msg]` | Stage, commit, and push changes to `iterations` branch. Default message: "[AI] Iteration update" |
| `git vibe.push [msg] [--origin]` | Auto-commits changes from `iterations` and snapshots them into `main`. Optional `--origin` pushes to remote. |
| `git vibe.snapshot [msg]` | Commit the current `iterations` state into `main` (manual) |
| `git vibe.pull [branch]` | Copy current state from `main` or specified branch into `iterations` |
| `git vibe.clean` | Rebase and clean up `iterations` history (backup auto-created) |
| `git vibe.list` | List all snapshots in `main` branch |
| `git vibe.restore <hash>` | Restore a specific snapshot to `iterations` branch |

---

## Typical Vibe Coding Flow

```bash
# 1. Work in iterations branch
$ git checkout iterations
$ # generate code with AI, commit changes

# 2. Push a snapshot to main
$ git vibe.push "Added new MIDI pipeline"

# 3. Keep hacking in iterations, or start new experiment
$ git checkout -b feature/refactor-bot

# 4. Pull a stable snapshot from main
$ git vibe.pull

# 5. Occasionally clean up your iteration history
$ git vibe.clean

# 6. Or manually snapshot when outside the standard flow
$ git vibe.snapshot "Stable voice routing test"
```

## What Makes Vibe-Flow Different?

- 🎛️ Snapshot-based: captures the current working state without polluting history
- 🔒 Clean `main`: no merge commits, no rebase risk
- 🎨 AI-compatible: supports messy commit logs while maintaining readable output
- 🧪 Safe cleanup: all rebase operations in `iterations` are backed up automatically

---

## Installing Vibe-Flow

### Global Setup

To make Vibe-Flow available in any project, install the `vibe.init` script globally using the provided installer:

```bash
bash vibe.flow.installer.sh
```

This will:
- Copy `vibe.init` to `~/bin/` (or create it if needed)
- Ensure `~/bin` is in your `$PATH`
- Make `vibe.init` globally available across all your Git projects

Then, within each project, run:

```bash
vibe.init
```

This sets up:
- Creates `.git-tools` directory with all necessary scripts
- Configures Git aliases for all vibe commands
- Creates `iterations` branch if it doesn't exist
- Optionally adds `.git-tools` to `.gitignore`

### Windows (Git Bash)

If you're using **Git Bash** on Windows:

- This script should work well in Git Bash environments, but I've not tested it, let me know of any issues or fixes, and I'll update the instructions accordingly
- `~/bin` usually maps to something like `C:\Users\<you>\bin`
- Ensure `~/bin` is included in your Git Bash `$PATH`
- You may need to manually edit `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`
- Restart Git Bash or run:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This sets up:
- Creates `.git-tools` directory with all necessary scripts
- Configures Git aliases for all vibe commands
- Creates `iterations` branch if it doesn't exist
- Optionally adds `.git-tools` to `.gitignore`

### Requirements

- **Git** must be installed and accessible in your shell.
- **Bash** is required for running the scripts:
  - ✅ Native support on Linux and macOS.
  - ✅ Windows users can use [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
  - ⚠️ PowerShell is *not* supported — the scripts rely on standard Bash behavior.
- Make sure your Git config allows custom aliases (`git config --global alias.vibe.push ...`).

## Integrating with AI Editors like Windsurf & Cursor

Vibe-Flow is a natural complement to AI-powered editors like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so) and [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf).

- In **Cursor**, you iterate rapidly and refactor freely — Vibe-Flow lets you checkpoint clean states without worrying about Git history noise.
- In **Windsurf**, when you accept AI suggestions or edits, you could wire in a post-accept hook or shell command to automatically:
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "Accepted AI edits via Windsurf"`

This means your project history reflects actual working checkpoints, not every change trial.

To automate this fully:

- Use Windsurf’s settings to define a post-edit command (or wrap your editor launch in a script)
- Combine it with `git vibe.snapshot` for structured commits that go straight to `main`

### Windsurf Integration Rules

Any Git repository with `.git-tools/vibe.push` is automatically detected as a Vibe-Flow enabled repo. When working in Windsurf:

1. After accepting AI changes, use:
   ```bash
   git vibe.iterate
   ```
   This will stage, commit, and push all changes to the `iterations` branch.

2. When satisfied with the changes:
   - Enter `save snapshot` command
   - You'll be prompted to run `git vibe.push` with appropriate commit messages to save your work to `main`

3. If you're not satisfied:
   - Enter `restore snapshot` to restore the last snapshot

This workflow ensures your AI-assisted development stays organized while maintaining the ability to experiment freely.

## .gitignore Recommendation

To avoid tracking the Vibe-Flow tooling in your repo:

```bash
# Add to your .gitignore
.git-tools/
```
