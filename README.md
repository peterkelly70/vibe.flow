> "A philosophy of structure that doesn’t fight creativity."

**Vibe-Flow** is more than a Git workflow — it's a mindset for working with large language models. It turns chaotic AI-generated code into reproducible, clean checkpoints without losing the rhythm of creativity. Inspired by jazz, automation, and sane defaults, it lets you guide your repo like a conductor guides an orchestra.

## Branch Philosophy

```text
main           ← Clean, linear history. Only snapshot commits from iterations.
  ↑
  │
iterations     ← Fast, messy, vibe-coded development zone.
  │
  ├── feature/foo   ← (optional) isolated experiments
```

## Git Commands (via Vibe-Flow)

| Command                   | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git vibe.push`           | Snapshot the current state of `iterations` into `main`                  |
| `git vibe.snapshot`       | Commit the current `iterations` state into `main` (manual alternative)  |
| `git vibe.pull [src]`     | Copy current state from `main` or `feature/X` into `iterations`         |
| `git vibe.clean`          | Rebase and clean up `iterations` history (backup auto-created)          |
| `git vibe.list`           | List past snapshot commits made from `iterations` into `main`           |
| `git vibe.restore <hash>` | Restore a previous snapshot from `main` into `iterations`               |

---

## Typical Vibe Coding Flow

```bash
# 1. Work in iterations branch
$ git checkout iterations
$ # generate code with AI, commit changes

# 2. Push a snapshot to main
$ git vibe.push "Added new MIDI pipeline"

# 3. Keep hacking in iterations, or start new experiment
$ git checkout -b feature/refactor-bot

# 4. Pull a stable snapshot from main
$ git vibe.pull

# 5. Occasionally clean up your iteration history
$ git vibe.clean

# 6. Or manually snapshot when outside the standard flow
$ git vibe.snapshot "Stable voice routing test"

# 7. List prior snapshots pushed to main
$ git vibe.list

# 8. Restore a previous snapshot to iterations
$ git vibe.restore 7cfa12b3
```

## What Makes Vibe-Flow Different?

- 🎛️ Snapshot-based: captures the current working state without polluting history
- 🔒 Clean `main`: no merge commits, no rebase risk
- 🎨 AI-compatible: supports messy commit logs while maintaining readable output
- 🧪 Safe cleanup: all rebase operations in `iterations` are backed up automatically

## Installing Vibe-Flow

### Global Setup

To make Vibe-Flow available in any project, install the `vibe.init` script globally using the provided installer:

```bash
bash vibe.flow.installer.sh
```

This will:

- Copy `vibe.init` to `~/bin/` (or create it if needed)
- Ensure `~/bin` is in your `$PATH`
- Make `vibe.init` globally available across all your Git projects

Then, within each project, run:

```bash
vibe.init
```

This sets up `.git-tools`, installs the vibe scripts, and registers aliases locally.

### Windows (Git Bash)

If you're using **Git Bash** on Windows:

- This script should work well in Git Bash environments, but I've not tested it, let me know of any issues or fixes, and I'll update the instructions accordingly
- `~/bin` usually maps to something like `C:\Users\<you>\bin`
- Ensure `~/bin` is included in your Git Bash `$PATH`
- You may need to manually edit `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`
- Restart Git Bash or run:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This sets up `.git-tools`, installs the vibe scripts, and registers aliases locally.

### Requirements

- **Git** must be installed and accessible in your shell.
- **Bash** is required for running the scripts:
  - ✅ Native support on Linux and macOS.
  - ✅ Windows users can use [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
  - ⚠️ PowerShell is *not* supported — the scripts rely on standard Bash behavior.
- Make sure your Git config allows custom aliases (`git config --global alias.vibe.push ...`).

## Integrating with AI Editors like Windsurf & Cursor

Vibe-Flow is a natural complement to AI-powered editors like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so) and [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf).

- In **Cursor**, you iterate rapidly and refactor freely — Vibe-Flow lets you checkpoint clean states without worrying about Git history noise.
- In **Windsurf**, when you accept AI suggestions or edits, you could wire in a post-accept hook or shell command to automatically:
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "Accepted AI edits via Windsurf"`

This means your project history reflects actual working checkpoints, not every change trial.

To automate this fully:

- Use Windsurf’s settings to define a post-edit command (or wrap your editor launch in a script)
- Combine it with `git vibe.snapshot` for structured commits that go straight to `main`

## .gitignore Recommendation

During setup, `vibe.init` will ask if you want to exclude the tooling from Git.

If you choose not to, you can still add it manually:

```bash
# Add to your .gitignore
.git-tools/
```
